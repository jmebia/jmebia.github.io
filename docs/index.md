## What I do
In professional settings, I mainly do fullstack web applications development (mostly focused on backend), from database design and architecture, to writing dynamic frontend pages.

When it comes to passion, I dive into my more creative side: designing and developing indie games in Godot. I also do digital illustrations and post them online!

Outside my working hours, I am a full-time beagle parent and I love to play either digital or tabletop games.
