![My portrait](assets/me.png){ align=left }



## What I do
I mainly do fullstack web applications development (mostly focused on backend), from database design and architecture, to writing dynamic frontend pages.

I also dive into my more creative side: designing and developing indie games in Godot.

Outside my working hours, I am a full-time beagle parent and I love to play either digital or tabletop games. I also do digital illustrations and post them online!
